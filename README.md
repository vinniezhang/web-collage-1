# Drawing on the Web -  Assignment 4

### Vinnie's remix of Claudia's HTML/CSS Assignment 1

The main piece of Claudia's assignment that I took and kept
is the gif of the "Girl with a Pearl Earring." That inspired me to 
use mixed medias centering around other famous pieces of artworks,
especially since there was an unused Mona Lisa jpg in the folder,
which I spliced to create the right-sided column of only Mona Lisa's eyes.
